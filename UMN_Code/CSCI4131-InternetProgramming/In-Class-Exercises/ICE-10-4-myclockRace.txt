The potential race condition is that the script (lines 6-14) would load before the clock does (line 17).
If this happens, line 10's 'document.getElementById("myclock")' would return null and null.value would
cause an error. In essence, the clock wouldn't work.

This could be fixed by setting the script to only run when the clock DOM element has loaded or when the
whole document is loaded. That way, the clock must be loaded before the script and the
'document.getElementById("myclock")' would not return null, resulting in null.value not causing an error.
